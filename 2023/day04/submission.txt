 **Tasks**

 - Explain in your own words and examples, what is Shell Scripting for DevOps.
Ans. We can say Shell Scripting for DevOps is a method of automating the execution of certain tasks and processes in a Linux based Operating System. Shell Scripts are also useful for automating routine system administration tasks, such as creating backups, monitoring performance, and managing user accounts.
Simple shell script Example:
A DevOps engineer might use a shell script to automate the process of taking a backup of a mysql server on daily basis.

 - What is `#!/bin/bash?` can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?
Ans. The `#!/bin/bash` is the first line in a shell script and it specifies which interpreter should be used to run the script. In this case, the interpreter specified is /bin/bash, which is the most commonly used shell interpreter on Linux systems.
The `#!/bin/sh` works as a symbolic link to the `#!/bin/bash` interpreter in many systems, and in some systems can also direct to other interpreters.

 - Write a Shell Script which prints `I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge`
Ans. #!/bin/bash
     echo "I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge"

 - Write a Shell Script to take user input, input from arguments and print the variables.
Ans. #!/bin/bash

     echo "Enter a value:"
     read user_input
     # Take input from arguments
     argument_input=$1
     echo "User input: $user_input"
     echo "Argument input: $argument_input"

 - Write an Example of If else in Shell Scripting by comparing 2 numbers
Ans. #!/bin/bash

     # Take user input for the first number
     echo "Enter the first number:"
     read num1

     # Take user input for the second number
     echo "Enter the second number:"
     read num2

     # Compare the numbers
     if [ $num1 -gt $num2 ]; then
        echo "The first number is greater than the second number."
     else
        echo "The first number is not greater than the second number."
     fi
