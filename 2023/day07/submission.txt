## Tasks

 1) You have to install docker and jenkins in your system from your terminal using package managers
Ans.
 # Installation of jenkins

 #installing supported java packages

 yum install java-11-openjdk.x86_64 -y

 #setting up the jenkins repository

 sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo

 #adding up the key for long term support

 sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key

 #installing jenkins

 yum install jenkins -y

 #starting the jenkins

 sudo systemctl start jenkins
 sudo systemctl status jenkins

 Once downloaded navigate to http://publicip:8080 for accessing jenkins gui on web browser

 # Installation of Docker

 #To remove all old docker packages:

 sudo yum remove docker \
                  docker-client \
                  docker-client-latest \
                  docker-common \
                  docker-latest \
                  docker-latest-logrotate \
                  docker-logrotate \
                  docker-engine

 #Installing yum-utils and yum-config-manager:

 sudo yum install -y yum-utils

 sudo yum-config-manager \
    --add-repo \
    https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

 #Installing the latest version of the docker

 sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin

 # Start the Docker

 sudo systemctl start docker

 # Run the command `sudo docker run hello-world` for verifying:

 sudo docker run hello-world

 Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world

Digest: sha256:aa0cc8055b82dc2509bed2e19b275c8f463506616377219d9642221ab53cf9fe
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:

 2) Write a small blog or article to install these tools using package managers on Ubuntu and CentOS

 3) check the status of docker service in your system (make sure you completed above tasks, else docker won't be installed)
Ans.

 #For seeing the status of the docker service:

 service docker status

Redirecting to /bin/systemctl status docker.service

 4) stop the service jenkins and post before and after screenshots

 5) read about the commands systemctl vs service

 eg. `systemctl status docker` vs `service docker status`

 systemctl and service are both Linux commands used to manage system services, but there are some differences between them:

Availability: systemctl is the default service management tool for recent versions of systemd-based distributions (such as Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and later), while service is used in older distributions (such as CentOS 6 and earlier, and Debian 7 and earlier).

Functionality: systemctl provides a comprehensive set of commands for managing system services, including starting, stopping, restarting, reloading, and checking the status of services. In contrast, service provides a simpler set of commands, limited to starting, stopping, and checking the status of services.

Syntax: The syntax of systemctl commands is more complex than that of service commands

Integration with system management: systemctl is integrated with other system management tools, such as journalctl, to provide a unified view of system logs and events. service does not have this integration.
In summary, systemctl provides more functionality and is more tightly integrated with the rest of the system management tools, but it also has a more complex syntax. service is simpler and easier to use, but provides fewer features.
