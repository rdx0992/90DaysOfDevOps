### Tasks 
1) You have to do the same using Shell Script i.e using either Loops or command with start day and end day variables using arguments -

 So Write a bash script createDirectories.sh that when the script is executed with three given arguments (one is directory name and second is start number of directories and third is the end number of directories ) it creates specified number of directories with a dynamic directory name.

Example 1: When the script is executed as

```./createDirectories.sh day 1 90```

then it creates 90 directories as ```day1 day2 day3 .... day90```

Example 2: When the script is executed as

```./createDirectories.sh Movie 20 50```
then it creates 50 directories as ```Movie20 Movie21 Movie23 ...Movie50```

Notes:
You may need to use loops or commands (or both), based on your preference . [Check out this reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bash-scripting-for-loop/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bash-scripting-for-loop/)
Ans:
#!/bin/bash
# Assign arguments to variables
dirname=$1
start=$2
end=$3
# Iterate from start to end
for i in $(seq $start $end)
    do
    mkdir "$dirname$i";
done


 2) Create a Script to backup all your work done till now.
Ans:
#!/bin/bash

datetime=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S)
if [ ! -d "backups" ]; then
    mkdir -p backups
fi

tar -cvzf backups/backup_$datetime.tar.gz ./*
echo "Backup complete: backups/backup_$datetime.tar.gz"


 5) Create 2 users and just display their Usernames
 Ans:
 sudo adduser rohit
Adding user `rohit' ...
Adding new group `rohit' (1001) ...
Adding new user `rohit' (1001) with group `rohit' ...
Creating home directory `/home/rohit' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for rohit
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
Full Name []:
Room Number []:
Work Phone []:
Home Phone []:
Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n] y


sanket@Sanket:~$ sudo adduser cento
Adding user `cento' ...
Adding new group `cento' (1002) ...
Adding new user `cento' (1002) with group `cento' ...
Creating home directory `/home/cento' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for cento
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
Full Name []:
Room Number []:
Work Phone []:
Home Phone []:
Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n] y

cat /etc/passwd

rohit:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/rohit:/bin/bash                                                                                                                                                     
cento:x:1002:1002:,,,:/home/cento:/bin/bash
