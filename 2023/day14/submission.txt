## Tasks
1. Give the Difference between List, Tuple and set. Do Handson and put screenshots as per your understanding.
Ans. List, Tuple, and Set are all data structures in Python used to store collections of items.

List: A list is a collection of items that are ordered, mutable (can be changed), and allows duplicates. Lists are defined by square brackets [].

Tuple: A tuple is similar to a list but it is ordered, immutable (cannot be changed), and allows duplicates. Tuples are defined by round parentheses ().

Set: A set is an unordered collection of unique items. It is mutable and does not allow duplicates. Sets are defined by curly braces {} or the set() function.

2. Create below Dictionary and use Dictionary methods to print your favourite tool just by using the keys of the Dictionary.
```
fav_tools = 
{ 
  1:"Linux", 
  2:"Git", 
  3:"Docker", 
  4:"Kubernetes", 
  5:"Terraform", 
  6:"Ansible", 
  7:"Chef"
}
```
Ans. 
fav_tools = {1:"Linux", 2:"Git", 3:"Docker", 4:"Kubernetes", 5:"Terraform", 6:"Ansible", 7:"Chef"}
for key in fav_tools:
  print(fav_tools[key])

3. Create a List of cloud service providers
eg.
```
cloud_providers = ["AWS","GCP","Azure"]
```
Ans.
cloud_providers = ['Amazon Web Services (AWS)', 'Microsoft Azure', 'Google Cloud Platform (GCP)', 'IBM Cloud', 'Alibaba Cloud', 'Oracle Cloud']

Write a program to add `Digital Ocean` to the list of cloud_providers and sort the list in alphabetical order.
Ans.
cloud_providers = ['Amazon Web Services (AWS)', 'Google Cloud Platform (GCP)', 'Microsoft Azure', 'IBM Cloud', 'Alibaba Cloud', 'Oracle Cloud']

cloud_providers.append("DigitalOcean")
cloud_providers.sort()

print(cloud_providers)
