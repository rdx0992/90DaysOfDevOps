## Task-1

Learn how to use the docker-compose.yml file, to set up the environment, configure the services and links between different containers, and also to use environment variables in the docker-compose.yml file. 
Ans.


## Task-2
- Pull a pre-existing Docker image from a public repository (e.g. Docker Hub) and run it on your local machine. Run the container as a non-root user (Hint- Use `usermod ` command to give user permission to docker). Make sure you reboot instance after giving permission to user.
- Inspect the container's running processes and exposed ports using the docker inspect command.
- Use the docker logs command to view the container's log output.
- Use the docker stop and docker start commands to stop and start the container.
- Use the docker rm command to remove the container when you're done.
Ans.
# pulling the pre existing docker image from the public registry
docker image pull debian

# running the container
docker run  --name os 80:80 -d debian:latest

# to check the docker logs
docker log --details debian

# to start and stop the container
docker stop debian

docker start debian

# to remove the container
docker rm <image-id>

## How to run Docker commands without sudo?
- Make sure docker is installed and system is updated (This is already been completed as a part of previous tasks):
- sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER 
- Reboot the machine.
