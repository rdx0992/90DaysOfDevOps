1) Create a simple file and do `ls -ltr` to see the details of the files [refer to Notes](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/90DaysOfDevOps/tree/master/2023/day6/notes)
 
 Each of the three permissions are assigned to three defined categories of users. The categories are:
-	   owner   —   The owner of the file or  application.
-	"chown" is used to change the ownership permission of a file or directory.
-	   group   —   The group that owns the file or application.
-	"chgrp" is used to change the gropu permission of a file or directory.
-	   others  —   All users with access to the system. (outised the users are in a group)
-	"chmod" is used to change the other users permissions of a file or directory.

    As a task, change the user permissions of the file and note the changes after `ls -ltr`

Ans.

sanket@Sanket:~/tes$ touch testing
sanket@Sanket:~/tes$ ls -lrth
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 sanket sanket 0 Jan 28 15:44 testing
sanket@Sanket:~/tes$ chmod u+rwx testing.txt
sanket@Sanket:~/tes$ ls -lrth
total 0
-rwxr--r-- 1 sanket sanket 0 Jan 28 15:44 testing

2) Write an article about File Permissions based on your understanding from the notes.

3) Read about ACL and try out the commands `getfacl` and `setfacl`
Ans.

Access Control Lists (ACLs) are a way to set more fine-grained permissions on files and directories in Linux. They allow you to set permissions for specific users or groups, rather than just the owner and group of a file.

setfacl: This command is used to set or modify ACLs on a file or directory. For example, to give user "sanket" read and execute permissions on a file named "example.txt", you can use the following command:
setfacl -m u:sanket:rx example.txt

getfacl: This command is used to view the current ACLs on a file or directory. For example, to view the ACLs on a file named "example.txt", you can use the following command:
getfacl example.txt
